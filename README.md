# KeyForge

## Decentralized Password Management System

KeyForge is a blockchain-based password manager that puts you in control of your credentials.

## What KeyForge Does

KeyForge securely stores and manages your passwords using encryption and blockchain technology. Unlike traditional password managers that keep your data in centralized databases, KeyForge:

- Encrypts your passwords so only you can access them
- Stores credentials on decentralized networks, not on company servers
- Uses your crypto wallet for authentication
- Keeps an unchangeable record of password history
